// This is an "interface" — a special kind of class that does NOT have any code inside the methods yet.
// An interface is like a "contract" — it says what methods a class must have, but not how they work.
// Classes that "implement" this interface will have to provide the actual code for these methods.

// The name DAO stands for "Data Access Object."
// A DAO is a class that is responsible for saving, retrieving, updating, or deleting data.
// In this case, FilmDao will manage Film objects.

    public interface FilmDao {

        // This method will allow us to add a new Film.
        // We pass in a Film object, and the DAO will store it.
        void add(Film film);

        // This method will return a list of all Films that have been stored.
        // It returns a List<Film> — a list of Film objects.
        List<Film> getAll();

        // NOTE:
        // Right now we are only adding 2 methods here.
        // Later we could add more methods to this interface, such as:
        // - deleteById(int filmId)
        // - findById(int filmId)
        // - update(Film film)
        // These methods would give us more ways to work with Films.
