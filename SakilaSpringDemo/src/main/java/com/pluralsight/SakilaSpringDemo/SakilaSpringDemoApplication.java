		// It does 3 main things:
		// 1. Creates the Spring "ApplicationContext" (this is like the brain of Spring that manages everything).
		// 2. Scans for your @Component classes (like FilmApp, SimpleFilmDao, etc.) and creates them automatically.
		// 3. Starts the web server (if your app had web controllers), or calls CommandLineRunner beans (like your FilmApp).

		SpringApplication.run(SakilaSpringDemoApplication.class, args);

		// After this line runs, your app is running!
		// If you have a CommandLineRunner (like FilmApp), its run() method will now be called.
